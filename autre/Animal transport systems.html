No less than a whale’s heart. 180 kg : the central organ of the biggest animal on the planet breaks records. In comparison, the human heart weighs approximately 250 grams. Scientists also found that a whale’s heart can reach a rate of 4 to 8 beats per minute during a dive : humans are said to undergo bradycardia, an abnormally low heart rate when going under 60 beats per minute. This incredible heart rate allows the whale to temporarily redistribute oxygen to muscles throughout the body when underwater. It is feasible thanks to a highly compliant and specialized set of vessels, carrying needed substances throughout the whale’s body, a transport system suited to its size allowing it to survive, reproduce and thrive in its environment. </span></p><p><big><span>O</span></big><span>ne could say the most basic transport system is the physical process of diffusion. Indeed, exchanges between animals and the outside world take place at the cellular level, as resources necessary for animal cells (such as nutrients and oxygen) cross the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm where they are used for metabolism, and as metabolic waste such as CO2 leave the cell by the same path. In unicellular organisms, exchanges with the external environment are established directly. But as soon as an organism&#39;s size increases, diffusion is not sufficient to provide every part of the body with the necessary nutrients : most multicellular organisms are incapable of carrying out direct exchanges of substances between each of their cells and the external environment. Consequently more complex transport systems arose during evolution to be able to fit the needs of animals, from specialized surfaces to conduct exchanges with the surrounding environment, to complex circuitries carrying substances (O2, CO2, glucose, amino acids, molecular messengers, metabolic products…) to cells throughout the body. </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/squarecube.png" style="zoom:67%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;"><small>(own work)</small></p><p><big><span>I</span></big><span>n this chapter, you will firstly learn about the cardiovascular system : after exploring the different types of system driving vital fluid throughout the body, you will see how the mammal circulatory system works : what vessels are involved ?

As we have seen previously, small molecules undergo </span><strong><span>diffusion</span></strong><span>, which is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area with a lower concentration. However, according to the inverse square law, the time taken by a molecule to travel a surface is proportional to the square of the distance : consequently, it can take up to 3h for a molecule to cross 1 cm ! As such, for all the cells of the body to participate in exchanges, two solutions are observed in nature. </span></p><p><big name="gv"><span>S</span></big><span>ome animals present a specific body plan allowing diffusion to be sufficient for adequate exchange of water, gas, nutrients and waste, as most cells of the body are in contact with the environment. Such animals do not need circulatory systems, and present a </span><strong><span>gastrovascular cavity</span></strong><span>, their primary organ for circulation and digestion, sometimes serving as an </span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_skeleton'><span>hydrostatic skeleton</span></a><span>. In jelly-fishes, corals, hydras, sea anemones or flatworms, a body envelope encloses a central cavity, in which liquid (mostly made of water) communicates with the external environment through an orifice. External and internal layers bathe in the liquid, which facilitates the exchanges : but while only cells in the inner layer of the cavity have access to the nutrients released by digestion, the fact that the body wall is only made of two cell layers makes it possible for nutrients to diffuse to the outer layer. </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/difcleo.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Simple scheme of the gastrovascular cavity in the jelly-fish and the flatworm<br><small>(own work)</small></p><p><big><span>H</span></big><span>owever, in organisms with more than just two cell layers, surfaces are too important to allow efficient diffusion and exchange. A </span><strong><span>cardiovascular system</span></strong><span> therefore allows to reduce the distance any molecule has to travel by diffusion to reach every cell of the organism, by connecting the aqueous environment of body cells to specialized organs, responsible in nutrients absorption, waste treatment or gas exchange. This system is made of three essential components : </span></p><ul><li><span>The circulatory fluid ; </span></li><li><span>A set of interconnecting vessels ; </span></li><li><span>A muscular pump, the heart, which powers the circulation using metabolic energy. </span></li></ul><p><big><span>I</span></big><span>nsects, spiders, crustaceans, and most molluscs have an </span><strong><span>open circulatory system</span></strong><span>. The circulatory fluid, the haemolymph, circulates freely in an open body cavity named hemocoel. Movement of the organism and contraction of the heart circulates the fluid by pumping it through the different vessels and into sinuses surrounding organs. There, exchange of gases and nutrients occurs between haemolymph and body cells, before the heart relaxation draws back the fluid through an opening named ostia. Due to the absence of arteries pumping the circulatory fluid, the pressure of the latter remains low. Therefore, oxygen takes longer to reach body cells : consequently, an open circulatory system is more suited to smaller animals with slower metabolism. On the other hand, it should be noted that this system consequently requires less energy ! </span></p><p><big><span>O</span></big><span>n the other hand, vertebrates have a </span><strong><span>closed circulatory system</span></strong><span>, known as the cardiovascular system, characterized by the circulation of blood, distinct from interstitial fluid and confined to vessels. The circulatory fluid circulates through the latter throughout the body by heart action, with blood vessels being ramified in each organ for chemical exchange between blood and interstitial fluid. When compared to an open system, the cardiovascular system operates at a much higher blood pressure : it is consequently more efficient in delivering blood throughout the body, and allows for organisms with higher metabolism. </span></p><h4><a name="112-the-main-structures-of-the-cardiovascular-system-of-vertebrates" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>1.1.2. The main structures of the cardiovascular system of vertebrates</span></h4><blockquote><p style="text-indent:0px;">Now that we have seen what are the different types of circulatory systems among animals, it is important to know what are the main structures involved : the vessels and the heart.</p></blockquote><p><strong><big><span>B</span></big><span>lood vessels</span></strong><span> are defined as “any of the </span><a href='https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/vessel'><span>vessels</span></a><span> in </span><a href='https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/cardiovascular-system'><span>cardiovascular system</span></a><span> and functions by carrying </span><a href='https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/blood'><span>blood</span></a><span> throughout the body of an animal”. Basically, they are very complex tubes that aim at transporting blood. Blood vessels could be divided in three major types, even if, as we will see, it should be considered as a highly connected system. </span></p><p><big><span>F</span></big><span>irst, the thinnest vessels : the </span><strong><span>capillaries</span></strong><span>. They are composed of endothelial cells (that form an endothelium) that allow for a frictionless pathway for the blood, and regulate exchanges between the bloodstream and the surrounding tissues. A subendothelial layer surrounds this endothelium. Moreover, they allow for organizing the growth and development of connective tissue cells that form the surrounding layers of the blood-vessel wall. This surrounding layer is the basal lamina. Capillaries aim at exchanging blood, but also interstitial fluid, that can be found between cells, bringing oxygen and nutrients to cells and removing waste. When a new fluid is made, the oldest goes to lymph vessels, becoming the lymph. Capillaries are situated in capillary beds that infiltrate tissues. Furthermore, you can distinguish </span><strong><span>continuous capillaries</span></strong><span> (with a continuous endothelial lining) that are present in the nervous system, in skin, and in skeletal striated muscles for instance. Small molecules can be transmitted by these capillaries, </span><em><span>via</span></em><span> transcytosis vesicles. In the nervous system, continuous capillaries form the </span><a href='https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/the-blood-brain-barrier'><span>blood brain barrier</span></a><span>, limiting the movement of cells and large molecules between the blood and the interstitial fluid surrounding the brain. </span><strong><span>Fenestrated capillaries</span></strong><span> have pores - fenestrae - that allow for large exchanges of bigger molecules. They are present in the intestine and in the kidneys, where exchanges are crucial. </span><strong><span>Discontinuous capillaries</span></strong><span> have intercellular slits, through which big molecules, such as hormones, can go. As such, capillaries are primordial for exchanges (02, CO2...) with tissues, and cells. </span></p><p><big><span>A</span></big><span>nother main type of vessels is the </span><strong><span>arteries</span></strong><span>. As for the capillaries, they are made of endothelial cells, and of a basal lamina, but they are also composed of smooth muscle and elastic fibers, in order to regulate the internal diameter. A structure called advancia acts in structural support. Arteries transport the blood from the heart to the organs. Within the organs, </span><strong><span>arterioles</span></strong><span> (small arteries that make the junction between an artery and capillaries) convey blood to capillaries. A particularity of the arteries, especially those near the heart, is that they are composed of elastic fibers, thus allowing for an absorption of the heart propulsion shock of the blood, and provoking the blood downstream. Muscular arteries have a higher composition in smooth muscle. Thanks to the autonomous nervous system, their diameter can vary, in order to modify the blood flow.</span></p><p style="background:rgba(0,128,0,0.25);padding:12px;text-indent:0px;"><b>Fun numbers:</b><br><span>‣ The diameter of <b>elastic arteries</b> is about 1,5 cm, while their thickness is about 1mm.</span>
<span>‣ The diameter of <b>muscular arteries</b> is about 6 mm, while their thickness is about 1mm.</span>
<span>‣ The diameter of <b>arterioles</b> is about 37 µm, while their thickness is about 6 µm.</span>
<span>‣ The diameter of <b>veins</b> is about 5 mm, while their thickness is about 0,5 mm.</span>
<span>‣ The diameter of <b>veinules</b> is about 20 µm, while their thickness is about 1 µm.</span>
</p><p><strong><big><span>V</span></big><span>eins</span></strong><span> are, as for the arteries, composed of an endothelium, a basal lamina, a thin layer of smooth muscle, and an advancia. They are especially made of fibrous tissue, and they carry out blood from capillaries to the heart. For instance, generally, a portal venous system occurs when capillary beds are related by veins, without going through the heart at first. In Humans, such a system exists in order to bring back blood from the stomach, the liver, and the spleen.</span></p><p><big><span>B</span></big><span>oth veins and arteries are composed of a tunica intima (endothelium + basal lamina), a tunica media which proportions vary depending on the vessel (elastic fibers + muscle fibers), and an external tunica, the advantice (elastic fibers + collagen). Venules connect capillaries and veins. Altogether, the arterioles, capillaries and venules set form a </span><strong><span>microcirculation</span></strong><span>. Veins present also present </span><strong><span>valves</span></strong><span> preventing blood from flowing back. </span>
<span>Furthermore, in all vessels, blood flows through what we call a lumen.</span></p><p><span>Here is a scheme presenting the structure of the different vessels that we just described. </span></p><p><img src="https://anatomyandphysiologyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/blood-vessel-wall-layers.jpg" style="zoom: 80%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">The structure of different vessels<br><small>(<a href="https://anatomyandphysiologyi.com/cardiovascular-system-blood-vessels/">The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels : Anatomy &amp; Physiology.</a>)</small></p><p><span>And what about the heart, at the centre of these vessels ? </span></p><p><big><span>T</span></big><span>he human </span><strong><span>heart</span></strong><span> is a central organ of the circulatory system. It acts as a pump, and it is made of a special striated cardiac muscle. It has four main cavities : </span></p><ul><li><span>The right ventricle, that is connected to the aorta through the aortic (semilunar) valve. The right ventricle is also connected </span><em><span>via</span></em><span> the tricuspid (atrioventricular) valve, to :</span></li><li><span>The right atrium, that is directly connected to the superior vena cava.</span></li><li><span>The left ventricle, that is connected to the pulmonary arteries through the pulmonary (semilunar) valve. The left ventricle is also connected </span><em><span>via</span></em><span> the mitral (atrioventricular) valve, to :</span></li><li><span>The left atrium, that is connected to the pulmonary veins.</span></li></ul><p><big><span>T</span></big><span>he ventricles are separated by the interventricular septum. O2 and nutrient supply within the septum is carried out by the coronary arteries, that are contiguous to the heart.</span></p><p><big><span>T</span></big><span>he heart is protected by the pericardium. As we will see, the blood that needs to be reoxygenated comes back from the body to the heart via the upper vena cava, and the lower vena cava. It enters the right atrium, that propels it to the right ventricle, that propels it to the pulmonary arteries that go to the lungs, where the blood will be filled up with oxygen. Once it is oxygenated, it comes back to the heart via the pulmonary veins, enters the left atrium, goes to the left ventricle, where it is propelled through the aorta, and then to the entire body.  To better understand this description, let’s have a look at the heart in action. Below is an animation of the heart beating, annotated with the different structures we just discussed about: </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/keurorf.gif" style="zoom:67%;" /></p><h4><a name="113-the-different-types-of-circulation-within-a-circulatory-system" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>1.1.3. The different types of circulation within a circulatory system</span></h4><blockquote><p style="text-indent:0px">What are the characteristics of the two types of circulation : single and double ?</p></blockquote><p><big><span>A</span></big><span> closed circulatory system is consequently characterized by specific structures, the different vessels and the muscular pump, the heart. However, natural selection led to multiple organization forms of these components, and consequently multiple operation mechanisms. </span></p><p><strong><big><span>S</span></big><span>ingle circulation</span></strong><span> in fishes and sharks consists in a single loop during which blood travels throughout the body and returns to its starting point. The heart itself only consists of two chambers, the atrium and the ventricle. The blood located in the atrium first flows inside the ventricle, which contraction sent it to the capillaries in respiratory organs. There, a net diffusion of O2 in the blood and CO2 out of the blood is observed : the O2-rich blood then circulates through a vessel to capillary beds throughout the body, where it releases its O2 to organs. Finally, the deoxygenated blood finishes its loop by returning to the heart.</span></p><p><big><span>M</span></big><span>ammals, like humans, reptiles, birds and amphibians are characterized by the </span><strong><span>double circulation</span></strong><span> in their cardiovascular system : the oxygenated blood comes back to the heart after passing to the respiratory organs, in order to be pumped to organs throughout the body. We should then distinguish between the right and left side of the system. </span></p><figure><table><thead><tr><th style='text-align:center;' ><span>Right side of the system</span><br><span>Pulmonary or pulmocutaneous circulation</span></th><th style='text-align:center;' ><span>Left side of the system</span><br><strong><span>Systemic circuit</span></strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>Within a double circulatory system, the right side of the heart pumps deoxygenated blood to capillary beds of respiratory tissues (lungs or skin), where blood fills with O2 and gets rid of CO2.</span></td><td style='text-align:center;' ><span>The now oxygenated blood enters the left side of the heart, which pumps it to capillary beds of the whole body, where gas exchange will take place to supply organs with the necessary oxygen.

Amphibians and reptiles have indeed a heart with three chambers, two atria and a ventricle. A thin barrier within the ventricle allows to divert oxygenated blood to the systemic circuit and O2-poor blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. Alligators, while having a completely divided ventricle, present a connection of left and right arteries at the heart exit. These partial connections between the two distinct circuits allow for these organisms to control the amount of blood flowing to the lungs and the rest of the circuit. They have consequently the ability to shut off the blood flow to unneeded lungs when underwater. </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/cardcircd.svg" alt="cardcircd" style="height:50vh;" /></p><h3><a name="12-driving-of-double-circulation-in-mammals" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>1.2.

O2-rich blood then flows from the lungs to the </span><strong><span>left atrium</span></strong><span>, via the </span><strong><span>pulmonary veins</span></strong><span>. When it gets into the </span><strong><span>left ventricle</span></strong><span>, the latter then pumps it into the </span><strong><span>systemic circuit</span></strong><span>, via the </span><strong><span>aorta</span></strong><span> and then the arteries. The aorta branches to multiple directions : forming the </span><strong><span>coronary arteries</span></strong><span> and supplying blood to the heart itself, or branching to capillary beds in the fore or hind limbs. When flowing in the capillaries, the blood releases its oxygen for the organs to function, and charges with CO2 (metabolic waste produced by cellular respiration). The capillaries then join to form </span><strong><span>venules</span></strong><span>, conveying blood to the </span><strong><span>veins</span></strong><span>. Oxygen-poor blood from the upper part of the body flows through the </span><strong><span>superior vena cava</span></strong><span>, while the blood coming from lower capillaries travels in the </span><strong><span>inferior vena cava</span></strong><span>.

How is the system coordinated ?</span></h4><blockquote><p style="text-indent:0px">The heart is made of multiple beating cells… So how can the system function perfectly as a whole ? </p></blockquote><p><big><span>I</span></big><span>n vertebrates, the heartbeat originates from the heart itself. Indeed, cardiac muscle cells are said to be </span><strong><span>autorhythmic</span></strong><span>, meaning that their contraction and relaxation can happen independently from any signal of the nervous system. Cell contraction occurs via a highly regulated process, due to a potential propagation. At rest, myocardial cells have negative membrane potential. When stimulated above a certain threshold, the opening of </span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-gated_ion_channel'><span>voltage-gated ion channels</span></a><span> leads to a flow of cations into the cell : it is the depolarization. The latter lead to the opening of voltage gated calcium channels : an influx of Ca2+ then causes the cell contraction. Finally, potassium channels reopen and a flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarization. But note that every cell has its own frequency of contraction. Thus, an electrical conduction system allows to coordinate and time perfectly the contraction of all cells. </span></p><p><big><span>T</span></big><span>he primary orchestrator of the whole system is a group of autorhythmic cells located in the wall of the right atrium, forming the </span><strong><span>sinoatrial node</span></strong><span> (SAN). An electrical signal is firstly generated in the SAN, and spread via </span><a href='https://biologydictionary.net/gap-junction/'><span>gap junctions</span></a><span> throughout the right atrium. Reaching </span><strong><span>Bachmann’s bundle</span></strong><span>, the signal arrives at the left atrium. As a whole, this initial spreading allows to stimulate atrial contraction. The signal then reaches the </span><strong><span>atrioventricular node</span></strong><span> (AV node), situated in the interatrial septum, the wall of tissue separating left and right atria. Here, the signal is delayed allowing the atria to completely empty its content into the ventricles before the contraction of the latter. After the atrioventricular node, the signal then passes into the left and right branches of the </span><strong><span>bundle of His</span></strong><span>, activating both ventricles. The branching of the bundle into multiple </span><strong><span>Purkinje fibers</span></strong><span> allows to stimulate individual groups of myocardial cells to contract, until the signal reaches the heart apex and the epicardium, the outer layer of the heart. The ventricular repolarization finally allows to restore the resting state. That’s it, we went through one contraction cycle of our heart ! </span></p><p style="background:rgba(0,128,0,0.25);padding:12px;text-indent:0px;"><b>Fun fact:</b><br>A normal SAN rhythm lies between 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). When the heart displays a lower beating rate, it is said to be bradycardia, and the contrary is called tachycardia.</p> <p style="background:rgba(0,128,0,0.25);padding:12px;text-indent:0px;"><b>Fun fact:</b><br>If the SAN dysfunction, the AV node can take over the electrical impulse initialization. When both fail to initialize electrical impulse, the ventricles can themselves do it ! </p><h4><a name="124-how-is-the-system-regulated-" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>1.2.4. How is the system regulated ?</span></h4><blockquote><p style="text-indent:0px">From your birth to the end of your life, the cardiac cycle allows for your body to function. But what influences this system and how is it regulated in order to work properly and adapt to situations affecting the organism ?</p></blockquote><p style="text-indent:0px;"><big>S</big>ome other physiological signals have an influence of the SAN and can consequently modify the heart rate. </p><p><big><span>T</span></big><span>he system is complex, and the heart rate consequently depends on many other parameters. First of all, let’s get interested in the </span><strong><span>autonomic nervous system</span></strong><span> (ANS). Part of the peripheral nervous system and controlled by centres located in the spinal cord, brainstem and hypothalamus, it regulates many components of </span><a href='https://www.britannica.com/science/homeostasis'><span>homeostasis</span></a><span>, such as blood pressure, body temperature and… heart rate. The ANS is divided in two interacting systems, with antagonistic effect : the </span><strong><span>sympathetic</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>parasympathetic</span></strong><span> nervous systems. The sympathetic system prepares the body for energy expenditure, for example in stressful situations, by releasing specific hormones. The binding of the latter to receptors in the heart increases intracellular Ca2+ concentration and consequently increases contractility and heart rate. On the other hand, the parasympathetic system is active in restful situations. For example, when acetylcholine binds to specific receptors in the heart, it decreases the rate of depolarization and the conduction velocity in the AV node, thus reducing the overall cardiac output. </span></p><p><big><span>T</span></big><span>he cardiovascular system is also heavily influenced by physiological, neurological, and pathological factors. Firstly the </span><strong><span>endocrine system</span></strong><span> : for example, while epinephrine or adrenaline can increase contractility by altering the sympathetic system, oestradiol tends to preferentially induce a parasympathetic activity. Temperature and humidity also have an influence on the heart rate : an increase of the body temperature of 1°C can raise the heart rate by 10 beats per minute ! Respiratory factors also have an important role to play : the heartbeat increases as air is breathed and decreases with expiration. </span>
<span>Finally, some environmental and lifestyle factors, such body position, exercise, energy drinks and alcohol, stress, medications and non-modifiable factors, such as age or gender, affect the heart rate, by inducing the SAN directly, or by activating either the parasympathetic or the sympathetic nervous system. </span>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hematopoiesis allows to maintain homeostatic levels of circulating blood cells, by producing no less than 500 billion of blood cells each day. Blood cells develop from </span><strong>hematopoietic stem cells </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">(HSCs) and are formed in the </span><strong>bone marrow</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> through the highly regulated process of hematopoiesis via growth factors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">HSCs have the unique ability to differentiate into ALL mature blood cell types : they are multipotent. HSCs can differentiate into two kinds of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">progenitor cells : </span><strong>myeloid</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or </span><strong>lymphoid </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">stem cells.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lymphoid stem cells give rise to lymphocytes (B and T cells), while myeloid progenitor cells lead to erythrocytes, neutrophils, basophils, monocytes, eosinophils, or platelets. As these stem cells mature, they undergo gene expression changes limiting the cell type it can become. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are also capable of extensive self-renewal : when they proliferate, one daughter cell remains a HSC while the other is assigned to a specific function.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cell type determination is highly linked to the location of differentiation, as stem cells can </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">survive, proliferate, and differentiate only if they are provided with specific signal proteins. The contact with appropriate supporting cells located in a specific location is therefore needed for the differentiation.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In developing embryos, blood formation occurs in aggregates of blood cells : as development progresses, blood formation occurs in liver and lymph nodes, but as the bone marrow develops, it takes up the responsibility of forming blood cells.</span></p></td>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The production of red blood cells is called </span><strong>erythropoiesis</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A lack of O2 detected in the body stimulates the production of the </span><strong>erythropoietin hormone</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> by the kidneys, consequently leading to the production of erythrocytes. Red blood cells undergo multiple stages of development, developing into erythroblasts (large cells containing nuclei and a small quantity of haemoglobin) and normoblasts (more haemoglobin and smaller nuclei) before becoming reticulocytes (immature red blood cells) and finally erythrocytes.&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks to their size and shape, erythrocytes can move easily through capillary beds. They contain a protein called </span><strong>haemoglobin</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which links oxygen. As erythrocytes pass through the lungs, O2 combines with the haem portion of haemoglobin forming oxyhaemoglobin. When passing through tissues, O2 is released. The biconcave shape of erythrocytes allows the surface to be increased for gas exchanges. To carry their function, erythrocytes lack a nuclei in order to make more space for hemoglobin, but also a mitochondria : ATP is only generated through anaerobic metabolism. </span></p></td>

Thrombin then converts fibrinogen, the inactive form of the coagulant, to fibrin. The latter finally aggregates in thread, trapping blood cells and sealing the wound with a clot.</span></span></p>

Blood pressure is also related to the size of the vessels. Vasoconstriction is the process by which vessels diameters get smaller. This happens especially in little vessels such as arterioles, and vasoconstriction is controlled by blood composition, nerves, hormones but also by physiological or pathological conditions (cardiovascular shock). On the contrary, vasodilatation consists in the increase of vessels’ diameter.

Cardiovascular abnormalities : conditions and diseases</span></h4><p><big><span>A</span></big><span> good way to better understand the functions of the circulatory system, and to better understand how it works could be to have a look at cardiovascular diseases. Cardiovascular diseases are diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels, and represent a wide range of disorders, from a minor vein or heart valve disturbance to deadly strokes. Cardiovascular diseases are highly represented in all populations, and are the world’s leading cause of death (with 16% of deaths globally). Thus, we could ask ourselves about the functioning of these diseases, and especially about the dysfunctions of the circulatory system leading to such problems. </span></p><p><big><span>A</span></big><span> common cardiovascular disease is called </span><strong><span>atherosclerosis</span></strong><span> (you can check this </span><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab9OZsDECZw'><span>video</span></a><span> (</span><em><span>How blood pressure works - Wilfred Manzano - YouTube.</span></em><span>) from 2mins23 to 3mins6), in which fatty acid deposits called plaques develop in the inner walls of arteries, obstructing them and causing them to harden. As we’ve seen last year, cholesterol is important for maintaining membrane fluidity. We can distinguish between two types of cholesterol : </span></p><ul><li><span>Low-density lipoprotein LDL that transports cholesterol from the liver for incorporation into the cells’ membranes ; </span></li></ul><ul><li><span>High-density lipoprotein HDL that scavenges excess cholesterol. </span></li></ul><p><big><span>A</span></big><span> too important LDL/HDL ratio results in a risk factor for developing atherosclerosis. When arteries are injured, inflammation goes off, and the immune cells take charge of the damaged cells and so of the cholesterol. As such, the fatty plaques develop, including more and more cholesterol molecules and fibrous tissues : an obstruction is forming, making the vessel walls thinner and more fragile. If the plaque removes, a thrombus can result in the arteries, that may lead to a heart attack or a stroke, (once again, you can watch this video, this time from 3.06 min to 3.22 min </span><em><span>:</span></em><span> </span><a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab9OZsDECZw'><em><span>How blood pressure works</span></em></a><span> </span><em><span>- Wilfred Manzano - YouTube.</span></em><span>). </span></p><p><big><span>I</span></big><span>n order to beat, the heart needs a constant and high O2 supply.

Amphibians can also breathe using lungs, however their lungs are significantly less developed than those of humans or birds. As such, as we have seen, their skin is also a needed respiratory surface to optimize gas exchange. Let’s take a closer look at the parts composing the human respiratory system. Human respiratory system is composed of the </span><strong><span>mouth and nose</span></strong><span> through which air can come in, a </span><strong><span>pharynx</span></strong><span> that delivers air to the </span><strong><span>trachea</span></strong><span> which in turns connects the throat with the lungs. </span><strong><span>Bronchial tubes</span></strong><span> are at the end of the trachea and go into each lung where they split into smaller tubes called </span><strong><span>bronchioles</span></strong><span>. At the end of the bronchioles there are lots of tiny air sacs called </span><strong><span>alveoli</span></strong><span>. Alveoli are greatly surrounded by many capillaries which are important for gas exchange between blood and lungs. Some important adaptations of alveoli include thinness (composed of only one cell layer), moistness (needed for gas to dissolve and be able to pass through the membrane), and big surface area. Note that birds also have </span><strong><span>air sacs</span></strong><span> which, even if not considered as a respiratory surface per se, allows to further improve the efficiency of gas exchange. Air sacs, which are present throughout the bird’s body, act as air pockets filling with air during inhalation and holding it to facilitate internal air passage in order for a continuous flow of large volumes of air through the lungs. </span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/lungs.png" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Lung structure.<br><small>(Lung, Wikipedia, 8 Feb. 2021.)</small></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/birdresp.png" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Avian lung structure.<br><small>(<a href="http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdrespiration.html">Bird Respiratory System</a>)</small></p><h3><a name="22-the-importance-of-respiratory-pigments-for-gas-exchange" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>2.2.

High concentrations of myoglobin in muscle cells allows organisms to hold their breath for a longer period of time since the primary function of myoglobin is to store oxygen.

For example, carbon dioxide and oxygen exert different partial pressures on the atmosphere, each independent of one another. Knowing partial pressure is important for predicting gas movement. Gases always move </span><strong><span>from higher pressure to lower pressure</span></strong><span> in order to equalize the pressure in the two connected regions. Since the partial pressure of oxygen is higher in the air than in blood, oxygen tends to diffuse from the atmosphere into the blood. The process is opposite for carbon dioxide. Additionally, the differences between partial pressures allows oxygen to move into the tissues and cells from arterial blood and eliminate carbon dioxide resulting from metabolism. </span></p><p><img src="http://www.brainkart.com/media/article/article-Exchange-of-Gases----m2n.jpg" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Exchange of gases due to partial pressures

Positive pressure breathing</span></h4><p><big><span>F</span></big><span>or breathing to occur, it is necessary to create a pressure gradient between the lungs and the environment. First of all, we will consider positive pressure breathing. It is called like that because amphibians actively create positive pressure (higher than that of the atmosphere) to create a gradient between the lungs and the mouth. Let’s take frog as an example. First of all frog gulps air into its mouth and then closes the mouth as well as the nostrils. Afterwards, the floor of the mouth moves upwards. This reduces the cavity of mouth space and consequently raises the pressure of the air. The air is consequently forced down the trachea and into the lungs since as we previously mentioned gases always move from places of higher pressure (in this case the mouth cavity) to regions of lower pressure (the lungs). Finally, elastic recoil of the lungs as well as compression of muscular body walls allow for exhalation.</span></p><h4><a name="233-negative-pressure-breathing" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>2.3.3. Negative pressure breathing</span></h4><p><big><span>C</span></big><span>ompared to amphibians, mammals including humans use what is called negative pressure breathing in order to draw air in. To create a gradient, diaphragm as well as ribs muscles are necessary. Since amphibians don’t have ribs, it makes it impossible for them to use negative pressure breathing. During inhalation, the diaphragm moves downward, while the contraction of rib muscles causes the ribs to move upward and outward at the same time. This enlarges the cavity of the chest. Due to enlarged chest cavity, air pressure in it decreases since the same amount of air is in the bigger space. Since the resulting air pressure is consequently lower than that of the atmosphere, the air is ‘pulled’ into the lungs. To exhale, the diaphragm moves upward, rib cage inward and downward, the space is reduced and the air is simply ‘pushed’ out of the lungs. </span></p><p><img src="http://thelessonlocker.com/kvhs/biology/negative_pressure_breathing.jpg" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;"><small>(<a href="http://thelessonlocker.com/kvhs/biology/negative_pressure_breathing.html">Negative pressure breathing</a>)</small></p><p style="background:rgba(0,128,0,0.25);padding:12px;text-indent:0px;"><b>Fun fact:</b><br>Humans can be taught to breathe like frogs using positive pressure breathing.

Breathing in mammals</span></h4><p><big><span>M</span></big><span>ammals use negative pressure breathing. Air enters the body from the mouth or nose and travels through the windpipes to the lungs. When air passes through the nasal passage it is warmed and cleaned. When air reaches the lungs, it fills tiny air sacs called alveoli. Alveoli are thin, have a moist surface and dense capillary network through which gas exchange can easily occur between the lungs and the blood. Since the partial pressure of oxygen is higher in the alveoli then in the incoming blood, oxygen diffuses from the lungs to capillaries. The opposite process takes place for carbon dioxide: the partial pressure of carbon dioxide is higher in the blood then in the lung and thus it diffuses out from the capillaries and is exhaled. To exhale, the diaphragm relaxes and moves upward while the muscles between the ribs move the rib cage downward and inward at the same time. Both diaphragm and rib muscles help to reduce the space of chest cavity and the air is pushed out of the lungs. </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/human.gif" style="zoom:80%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Human breathing system<br><small>(<a href="http://tabletopwhale.com/page13/">Eleanor Lutz</a>)</small></p><p><span>In humans, breathing is controlled by the nervous system, as for the cardiovascular system seen before: </span></p><ul><li><span>The </span><strong><span>parasympathetic system</span></strong><span> slows down the breathing rate by causing the bronchial tubes to narrow and pulmonary blood vessels to widen</span></li><li><span>The </span><strong><span>sympathetic system</span></strong><span> increases the breathing rate by causing the bronchial tubes to widen and pulmonary blood vessels to narrow. </span></li></ul><p><span>To help control the breathing there are different sensors in the body that send signals to the brain to increase or decrease the respiratory rate.

Breathing in fish</span></h4><p><span>Fishes live underwater and compared to mammals they cannot rely on obtaining oxygen from air. They consequently rely on oxygen resources of water. Firstly, using their mouth they pull oxygen-rich water which later can pass through the gills. Gills are made of filaments each of which contain a capillary network which provides surface area for exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is way less soluble in water than in air : for fish to efficiently conduct gas exchange, countercurrent exchange is necessary. Consequently, water in the gills and blood flows in the opposite directions to maximize the area through which gas exchange occurs. Countercurrent exchange allows diffusion to occur throughout all the length of the gill. The gills push the oxygen poor water out through openings in the sides of the pharynx. </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/gill2.png" style="zoom:67%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Fish breathing mechanism<br><small>(<a href="http://3esofretamar.blogspot.com/2014/02/">Pampillón, Publicado por Rafael.

Breathing in insects</span></h4><p><span>As we have seen, in insects, air enters the body through external openings called spiracles. The air then travels to the so-called tracheal trunk which eventually branches to multiple tracheal tubes that reach every part of the body. At the end of these tracheal tubes, is a moist specialized structure called tracheole providing a suitable surface for the gas exchange. In insects the air diffuses from the tracheoles directly into the tissues due to the small size of the organism. Produced carbon dioxide diffuses out through the spiracles located at the end of the body. Additionally, some insects that are adapted to flying have air sacs, yet the functions of air sacs, especially in the respiration of insects are still being discussed. </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/insect.gif" style="zoom:67%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Insect breathing system<br><small>(<a href="http://tabletopwhale.com/page13/">Eleanor Lutz</a>)</small></p><h4><a name="244-breathing-in-amphibians" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>2.4.4. Breathing in amphibians</span></h4><p><span>Amphibians can use both lungs and skin for respiration. Before becoming an adult amphibians, the latter are aquatic larvae. At this stage, breathing occurs through the thin skin as well as gills. Frog tadpoles can in addition use their tail fins. When larvae develop, the gills degenerate and a pair of lungs emerge. Amphibian lungs are simple saclike structures and lack the spongy appearance similar to that of the mammals or avian lungs. When inhaling the floor of the mouth is depressed, the air enters through the nostrils after which the nostrils are closed, the floor of the mouth is elevated and air is later pushed into the lungs. Later the gas exchange in the lungs occurs according to the mechanism seen in mammals. For gas exchange to occur through the skin, the skin simply contains a dense network of capillaries. Since the skin is thin and moist, the oxygen in the air can simply dissolve and diffuse from the air directly into the capillaries. Most of carbon dioxide is eliminated through the skin. </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/frog.png" style="zoom:67%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Frog breathing system<br><small>(<a href="https://www.onlinebiologynotes.com/respiratory-system-of-frog/">Karki, Gaurab. “Respiratory System of Frog.” Online Biology Notes, 7 Sept. 2020</a>)</small></p><h4><a name="245-breathing-in-birds" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>2.4.5. Breathing in birds</span></h4><p><span>Birds, more than many organisms, require a fast metabolism and have high demands for oxygen, especially during the times of fly. Therefore, it was essential for them to develop certain adaptations to increase and maximize gas exchange during each breath. While birds have relatively small lungs, they have additional 9 air sacs which play an important role in birds respiration. When inhaled some air enters the lungs where gas exchange occurs following the same mechanism we have seen in mammals while some fill the posterior air sacs. During the first exhalation, fresh air from posterior sacs enters the lungs and gas exchange occurs while the air that was before in the lungs is exhaled and eliminated through trachea. During the second inhalation fresh air again enters the lungs and the posterior sacs but now air spent in the lungs cannot go out from the trachea since it would meet with the fresh air entering. Instead the air that was in the lungs goes to anterior air sacs. During the second exhalation, the air from anterior sacs and lungs leave the body through trachea and the fresh air that was in posterior sacs enter the lungs. </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/bird.gif" style="zoom:67%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Bird breathing system<br><small>(<a href="http://tabletopwhale.com/page13/">Eleanor Lutz</a>)</small></p><h2><a name="3-other-transport-systems" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>3.

Fluid balance</span></h4><p><big><span>A</span></big><span>s blood flows through capillaries, it irrigates tissue as some blood plasma, packed with the nutrients needed by tissue cells, seeps through small pores in the vessels. This liquid finds its way in the tissue itself, where it is known as </span><strong><span>interstitial</span></strong><span> (or extracellular) </span><strong><span>fluid</span></strong><span>. Some of this extra plasma, once its resources have been depleted, flows back in the blood capillaries, but not at a rate sufficient to stop accumulation. If this reserve of fluid builds up, it leads to a condition known as hypovolemia, a reduction of the volume of circulating blood, which may lead to hypotension, acidification of the blood and eventually heart failure. In addition to that, interstitial fluid contains various concentrations of essential proteins, which can&#39;t be lost out of the vessels. To avoid these unfortunate conditions, the random luck of evolution has gradually elaborated a variety of small lymphatic capillaries, able to drain this interstitial fluid from tissues, and to redirect it to blood circulation by use of a network of vessels, propelled by small muscles. Along the lymphatic vessels, a series of </span><strong><span>valves</span></strong><span> avoid reflux, as the smaller vessels lead to greater ones, called </span><strong><span>lymphatic trunks</span></strong><span>, eventually opening on to veins, at </span><strong><span>lymphatic ducts</span></strong><span>.

The chylomicrons enter lymph through lacteals, and can thus reach blood circulation via the lymphatic circulation.

The anatomical systems involved in this process can be qualified as a transport systems, as they allows circulation of products from the outside environments into individual cells, relying on the previously described circulatory system for distribution throughout the organisms.</span>
<span>This intake of energy and molecules has taken many simple forms before evolving into the digestive system as we know it in humans and other mammals.</span></p><h4><a name="321-early-forms" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>3.2.1. Early forms</span></h4><p><big><span>A</span></big><span>s was mentioned before, digestive systems originated from the complexification of organisms and their growing size. In simple cellular organisms, nutrient absorption is mostly done intracellularly, in a process called </span><strong><span>endocytosis</span></strong><span>, variations of which are shown below. The main principle is that any food particle or molecule too large to go through the membrane is ingested by vesicle formation, and decomposed via a variety of enzymes by organelles called </span><strong><span>lysosomes</span></strong><span>.</span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/image-20210222075520842.png" alt="image-20210222075520842" style="zoom: 33%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Basic cellular nutrient absorption principles<br><small>(Steinmetz 2019)</small></p><p><big><span>H</span></big><span>owever, quite soon in animal evolution, invertebrate organisms started digesting extracellularly. Organisms became hollow, and rather than taking in large food particles, they released enzymes out of the cell, to a </span><strong><span>digestive cavity</span></strong><span> through which food passes. This is highly beneficial to animals, as it allows for assimilation of food larger than the cell and thus higher alimentary diversity, and doesn&#39;t rely on the mass production of lysosomes, which was energetically costly and required a very large exchange area.</span>
<span>Early digestive cavities include the single-opening </span><strong><span>gastrovascular cavity</span></strong><sup><span> (</span><a href='#gv'><span>previously mentioned</span></a><span>)</span></sup><span>, the opening acting as a mouth and anus, as well as the precursor to most of the vertebrates digestive tract, and the double-opening </span><strong><span>alimentary canal</span></strong><span>, with a mouth for ingestion, intestine for absorption and anus for excretion.</span></p><p><span>The tubular structure of the alimentary canal, paired with the specialisation of cells in multicellular organisms, makes for a division of the digestive process along the tube, resulting in more efficiency and a greater evolutionary potential.</span></p><p><img src="https://openstax.org/resources/e5ddc9c78cd5c4f611db57562be8d86aaacaf763" alt="img" style="zoom: 50%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Invertebrate digestive systems.<br> <u>Top</u> : Hydra and cnidaria (jellyfish). <u>Bottom</u> : Nematode (worm)<br><small>(OpenStax Biology 34.1)</small></p><p><span>From these elementary digestion and absorption cavities, more complex digestive structures appeared, allowing for the processing of different types of food.</span></p><h4><a name="322-various-vertebrate-gut-structures" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>3.2.2. Various vertebrate gut structures</span></h4><p><span>A general digestive system can be broken down to three main points. First, food enters the system through a buccal cavity, or </span><strong><span>mouth</span></strong><span>, a process called </span><strong><span>ingestion</span></strong><span>. It is then processed and </span><strong><span>absorbed</span></strong><span> into the organism as it passes through a </span><strong><span>digestive tract</span></strong><span>, composed of a variety of cavities and organs specialised in different functions, the </span><strong><span>guts</span></strong><span>. Finally, waste is excreted at the </span><strong><span>anus</span></strong><span>, in what is sometimes called egestion.</span></p><p><span>Buccal cavities vary in form and function among animals, but always serve the same basic purpose of passage to the digestive tract. Some mechanical and chemical processing of foods can also be done in the mouth, thanks to diverse glands, bones and muscles.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574021/bin/WDEV-6-na-g005.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Mouths in various animal <br>Md : mandible, Mx : maxilla, P : pharynx, T : teeth, Tg : tongue.<br><small>(Chen et al. 2017)</small></p><p><span>The inner gut structure of animals can be separated in four basic types :</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Monogastric</span></strong><span> : very common in mammals, including humans, the digestive system contains a single stomach chamber. The food, after being ingested at the mouth, is passed through the oesophagus to the stomach by </span><strong><span>deglutition</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>peristalsis</span></strong><span>, a wave-like smooth (autonomous) muscle contraction. The stomach is an acidic chamber in which digestive enzymes can function optimally and some pathogens are killed. From there, the partially digested food makes its way to the small intestine, where enzymes secreted in the liver, pancreas and other glands act to break it down further, and nutrients are absorbed through epithelial cells organized in the previously mentioned villi. A number of monogastric systems contain a </span><strong><span>cecum</span></strong><span>, a cavity used to store digested food, in the aim of ingesting and digesting them again. The end of the digestive tracts consists in a large intestine (or colon), which absorbs mostly water and ions, drying up the processed food into </span><strong><span>faeces</span></strong><span>, which is then excreted through the anus by bowel movements.</span></li><li><strong><span>Avian</span></strong><span> : The difference between monogastric and avian guts comes mostly from the lack of mechanical processing in the mouth of birds. Indeed, while early mastication allows for an easy processing of food in the digestive tract, the avian stomach must take this function. The stomach is thus separated in two chambers, the </span><strong><span>proventriculus</span></strong><span> which produces the necessary gastric juices, and the highly musculated </span><strong><span>gizzard</span></strong><span>, where food is then soaked and mechanically ground.</span>
<span>As is the case in many other animals, the avian digestive system contains a </span><strong><span>crop</span></strong><span>, a cavity used for storage of food, close to the beginning of the digestive tract.</span>
<span>Finally, the avian function of excretion goes to the unique </span><strong><span>cloaca</span></strong><span> opening, rather than a specific anus.</span></li><li><strong><span>Ruminant</span></strong><span> : Animals that are classified as ruminants are generally herbivores, and feed mostly on </span><strong><span>cellulose</span></strong><span>. To process this heavy polymer, ruminants rely on a </span><strong><span>four-chambered</span></strong><span> stomach, in which an extensive </span><strong><span>microbiome</span></strong><span> will break down and ferment it, as well as, for some, a regurgitation process allowing for multiple mastication passages.</span></li><li><strong><span>Pseudo-ruminant</span></strong><span> : Pseudo-ruminants, like camels or alpacas, differ from regular ruminants in their gut structure, in the fact that they contain a three chamber stomach, and rely on a large cecum for cellulose digestion.</span></li></ul><center><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Figure_34_01_05ab.jpg/800px-Figure_34_01_05ab.jpg" style="zoom:50%;"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b0/Figure_34_01_06.jpg/538px-Figure_34_01_06.jpg" style="zoom: 33%;"><img src="https://openstax.org/resources/879aab75f67cd9611ce39e3f860c67c9b9c27695" style="zoom:33%"></center><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Types of gut structure<br>Top left are two monogastric animals, top right is an example of avian guts and bottom is a ruminant system<br><small>(OpenStax Biology 34.1)</small></p><p style="background:rgba(0,0,128,0.25);padding:12px;text-indent:0px;"><b>Pathology:</b><br>Deglutition, or swallowing, is a very complex process, which can malfunction or get painful, in what's called <b>dysphagia</b> <sup><small>(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6140149/">ref</a>)</small></sup></p><p><span>As previously established, in order for large pieces of food to enter and pass through the digestive tract safely, mechanical processing is done by a selection of organs in a variety of animals, in the mouth and further down.

Animal bodies rely heavily on fluid balance for good function, as cells throughout the body are supported by osmotic pressure, relying on an equilibrium between water and electrolytes, essential solvable ions. This means that these 2L of water a day need to be evacuated from the organism in order for a constant fluid volume to be achieved. This maintaining process, called osmoregulation, is done by capital organs : the kidneys. Not only are they needed for the support of cells across the organism and regulation of blood pressure and pH, they also ensure a proper evacuation of waste and act as a biochemical centre, notably by synthesizing a few hormones.</span></p><p style="background:rgba(0,0,128,0.25);padding:12px;text-indent:0px;"><b>Pathology:</b><br>Electrolyte imbalance is a common clinical disorder, and leads to a wide variety of symptoms <sup><small>(<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.5847%2Fwjem.j.issn.1920-8642.2013.02.005">ref</a>)</small></sup></p><p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Membrane_potential_ions_en.svg/1280px-Membrane_potential_ions_en.svg.png" style="zoom: 33%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Electrolyte imbalance at cell membrane produces voltage difference, essential for a number of processes<br><small>(Biezl on Wikimedia Commons)</small></p><p style="background:rgba(0,128,0,0.25);padding:12px;text-indent:0px;"><b>Fun calculations:</b><br>Osmotic pressure is quantified by a unit known as <b>milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L)</b>: the mEq/L is equal to the ion concentration (in millimoles) multiplied by its number of electrical charges.
