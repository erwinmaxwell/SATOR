No less than a whale’s heart. 180 kg : the central organ of the biggest animal on the planet breaks records. In comparison, the human heart weighs approximately 250 grams. Scientists also found that a whale’s heart can reach a rate of 4 to 8 beats per minute during a dive : humans are said to undergo bradycardia, an abnormally low heart rate when going under 60 beats per minute. This incredible heart rate allows the whale to temporarily redistribute oxygen to muscles throughout the body when underwater. It is feasible thanks to a highly compliant and specialized set of vessels, carrying needed substances throughout the whale’s body, a transport system suited to its size allowing it to survive, reproduce and thrive in its environment. </span></p><p><big><span>O</span></big><span>ne could say the most basic transport system is the physical process of diffusion. Indeed, exchanges between animals and the outside world take place at the cellular level, as resources necessary for animal cells (such as nutrients and oxygen) cross the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm where they are used for metabolism, and as metabolic waste such as CO2 leave the cell by the same path. In unicellular organisms, exchanges with the external environment are established directly. But as soon as an organism&#39;s size increases, diffusion is not sufficient to provide every part of the body with the necessary nutrients : most multicellular organisms are incapable of carrying out direct exchanges of substances between each of their cells and the external environment. Consequently more complex transport systems arose during evolution to be able to fit the needs of animals, from specialized surfaces to conduct exchanges with the surrounding environment, to complex circuitries carrying substances (O2, CO2, glucose, amino acids, molecular messengers, metabolic products…) to cells throughout the body. </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/squarecube.png" style="zoom:67%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;"><small>(own work)</small></p><p><big><span>I</span></big><span>n this chapter, you will firstly learn about the cardiovascular system : after exploring the different types of system driving vital fluid throughout the body, you will see how the mammal circulatory system works : what vessels are involved ?

Different types of circulatory systems</span></h4><blockquote><p style="text-indent:0px;">How do animal body organization and system allow for efficient exchanges between the organism and the environment ? </p></blockquote><p><span>To be able to have access to enough resources (nutrients and O2) and get rid of metabolic waste, each cell of a living organism needs to participate in molecular exchanges taking place between the environment and the organism. As we have seen previously, small molecules undergo </span><strong><span>diffusion</span></strong><span>, which is the movement of molecules from an area of high concentration to an area with a lower concentration. However, according to the inverse square law, the time taken by a molecule to travel a surface is proportional to the square of the distance : consequently, it can take up to 3h for a molecule to cross 1 cm ! As such, for all the cells of the body to participate in exchanges, two solutions are observed in nature. </span></p><p><big name="gv"><span>S</span></big><span>ome animals present a specific body plan allowing diffusion to be sufficient for adequate exchange of water, gas, nutrients and waste, as most cells of the body are in contact with the environment. Such animals do not need circulatory systems, and present a </span><strong><span>gastrovascular cavity</span></strong><span>, their primary organ for circulation and digestion, sometimes serving as an </span><a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_skeleton'><span>hydrostatic skeleton</span></a><span>. In jelly-fishes, corals, hydras, sea anemones or flatworms, a body envelope encloses a central cavity, in which liquid (mostly made of water) communicates with the external environment through an orifice. External and internal layers bathe in the liquid, which facilitates the exchanges : but while only cells in the inner layer of the cavity have access to the nutrients released by digestion, the fact that the body wall is only made of two cell layers makes it possible for nutrients to diffuse to the outer layer. </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/difcleo.png" style="zoom:50%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Simple scheme of the gastrovascular cavity in the jelly-fish and the flatworm<br><small>(own work)</small></p><p><span>However, in organisms with more than just two cell layers, surfaces are too important to allow efficient diffusion and exchange. A </span><strong><span>cardiovascular system</span></strong><span> therefore allows to reduce the distance any molecule has to travel by diffusion to reach every cell of the organism, by connecting the aqueous environment of body cells to specialized organs, responsible in nutrients absorption, waste treatment or gas exchange. This system is made of three essential components : </span></p><ul><li><span>The circulatory fluid ; </span></li><li><span>A set of interconnecting vessels ; </span></li><li><span>A muscular pump, the heart, which powers the circulation using metabolic energy. </span></li></ul><p><span>Insects, spiders, crustaceans, and most molluscs have an </span><strong><span>open circulatory system</span></strong><span>. The circulatory fluid, the haemolymph, circulates freely in an open body cavity named hemocoel. Movement of the organism and contraction of the heart circulates the fluid by pumping it through the different vessels and into sinuses surrounding organs. There, exchange of gases and nutrients occurs between haemolymph and body cells, before the heart relaxation draws back the fluid through an opening named ostia. Due to the absence of arteries pumping the circulatory fluid, the pressure of the latter remains low. Therefore, oxygen takes longer to reach body cells : consequently, an open circulatory system is more suited to smaller animals with slower metabolism. On the other hand, it should be noted that this system consequently requires less energy ! </span></p><p><span>On the other hand, vertebrates have a </span><strong><span>closed circulatory system</span></strong><span>, known as the cardiovascular system, characterized by the circulation of blood, distinct from interstitial fluid and confined to vessels. The circulatory fluid circulates through the latter throughout the body by heart action, with blood vessels being ramified in each organ for chemical exchange between blood and interstitial fluid. When compared to an open system, the cardiovascular system operates at a much higher blood pressure : it is consequently more efficient in delivering blood throughout the body, and allows for organisms with higher metabolism. </span></p><h4><a name="112-main-structures-involved-for-vertebrate" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>1.1.2. Main structures involved for vertebrate</span></h4><blockquote><p style="text-indent:0px;">Now that we have seen what are the different types of circulatory systems among animals, it is important to know what are the main structures involved : the vessels and the heart.</p></blockquote><p><strong><span>Blood vessels</span></strong><span> are defined as “any of the </span><a href='https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/vessel'><span>vessels</span></a><span> in </span><a href='https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/cardiovascular-system'><span>cardiovascular system</span></a><span> and functions by carrying </span><a href='https://www.biologyonline.com/dictionary/blood'><span>blood</span></a><span> throughout the body of an animal”. Basically, they are very complex tubes that aim at transporting blood. Blood vessels could be divided in three major types, even if, as we will see, it should be considered as a highly connected system. </span></p><p><span>First, the thinnest vessels : the </span><strong><span>capillaries</span></strong><span>. They are composed of endothelial cells (that form an endothelium) that allow for a frictionless pathway for the blood, and regulate exchanges between the bloodstream and the surrounding tissues. A subendothelial layer surrounds this endothelium. Moreover, they allow for organizing the growth and development of connective tissue cells that form the surrounding layers of the blood-vessel wall. This surrounding layer is the basal lamina. Capillaries aim at exchanging blood, but also interstitial fluid, that can be found between cells, bringing oxygen and nutrients to cells and removing waste. When a new fluid is made, the oldest goes to lymph vessels, becoming the lymph. Capillaries are situated in capillary beds that infiltrate tissues. Furthermore, you can distinguish </span><strong><span>continuous capillaries</span></strong><span> (with a continuous endothelial lining) that are present in the nervous system, in skin, and in skeletal striated muscles for instance. Small molecules can be transmitted by these capillaries, </span><em><span>via</span></em><span> transcytosis vesicles. In the nervous system, continuous capillaries form the </span><a href='https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/the-blood-brain-barrier'><span>blood brain barrier</span></a><span>, limiting the movement of cells and large molecules between the blood and the interstitial fluid surrounding the brain. </span><strong><span>Fenestrated capillaries</span></strong><span> have pores - fenestrae - that allow for large exchanges of bigger molecules. They are present in the intestine and in the kidneys, where exchanges are crucial. </span><strong><span>Discontinuous capillaries</span></strong><span> have intercellular slits, through which big molecules, such as hormones, can go. As such, capillaries are primordial for exchanges (02, CO2...) with tissues, and cells. </span></p><p><span>Another main type of vessels is the </span><strong><span>arteries</span></strong><span>. As for the capillaries, they are made of endothelial cells, and of a basal lamina, but they are also composed of smooth muscle and elastic fibers, in order to regulate the internal diameter. A structure called advancia acts in structural support. Arteries transport the blood from the heart to the organs. Within the organs, </span><strong><span>arterioles</span></strong><span> (small arteries that make the junction between an artery and capillaries) convey blood to capillaries. A particularity of the arteries, especially those near the heart, is that they are composed of elastic fibers, thus allowing for an absorption of the heart propulsion shock of the blood, and provoking the blood downstream. Muscular arteries have a higher composition in smooth muscle. Thanks to the autonomous nervous system, their diameter can vary, in order to modify the blood flow.</span></p><p style="background:rgba(0,128,0,0.25);padding:12px;text-indent:0px;"><b>Fun numbers:</b><br><span>‣ The diameter of <b>elastic arteries</b> is about 1,5 cm, while their thickness is about 1mm.</span>
<span>‣ The diameter of <b>muscular arteries</b> is about 6 mm, while their thickness is about 1mm.</span>
<span>‣ The diameter of <b>arterioles</b> is about 37 µm, while their thickness is about 6 µm.</span>
<span>‣ The diameter of <b>veins</b> is about 5 mm, while their thickness is about 0,5 mm.</span>
<span>‣ The diameter of <b>veinules</b> is about 20 µm, while their thickness is about 1 µm.</span>
</p><p><strong><span>Veins</span></strong><span> are, as for the arteries, composed of an endothelium, a basal lamina, a thin layer of smooth muscle, and an advancia. They are especially made of fibrous tissue, and they carry out blood from capillaries to the heart. For instance, generally, a portal venous system occurs when capillary beds are related by veins, without going through the heart at first. In Humans, such a system exists in order to bring back blood from the stomach, the liver, and the spleen.</span></p><p><span>Both veins and arteries are composed of a tunica intima (endothelium + basal lamina), a tunica media which proportions vary depending on the vessel (elastic fibers + muscle fibers), and an external tunica, the advantice (elastic fibers + collagen). Venules connect capillaries and veins. Altogether, the arterioles, capillaries and venules set form a </span><strong><span>microcirculation</span></strong><span>. Veins present also present </span><strong><span>valves</span></strong><span> preventing blood from flowing back. </span>
<span>Furthermore, in all vessels, blood flows through what we call a lumen.</span></p><p><span>Here is a scheme presenting the structure of the different vessels that we just described. </span></p><p><img src="https://anatomyandphysiologyi.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/blood-vessel-wall-layers.jpg" style="zoom: 80%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">The structure of different vessels<br><small>(<a href="https://anatomyandphysiologyi.com/cardiovascular-system-blood-vessels/">The Cardiovascular System: Blood Vessels : Anatomy &amp; Physiology.</a>)</small></p><p><span>And what about the heart, at the centre of these vessels ? </span></p><p><span>The human </span><strong><span>heart</span></strong><span> is a central organ of the circulatory system. It acts as a pump, and it is made of a special striated cardiac muscle. It has four main cavities : </span></p><ul><li><span>The right ventricle, that is connected to the aorta through the aortic (semilunar) valve. The right ventricle is also connected </span><em><span>via</span></em><span> the tricuspid (atrioventricular) valve, to :</span></li><li><span>The right atrium, that is directly connected to the superior vena cava.</span></li><li><span>The left ventricle, that is connected to the pulmonary arteries through the pulmonary (semilunar) valve. The left ventricle is also connected </span><em><span>via</span></em><span> the mitral (atrioventricular) valve, to :</span></li><li><span>The left atrium, that is connected to the pulmonary veins.</span></li></ul><p><span>The ventricles are separated by the interventricular septum. O2 and nutrient supply within the septum is carried out by the coronary arteries, that are contiguous to the heart.</span></p><p><span>The heart is protected by the pericardium. As we will see, the blood that needs to be reoxygenated comes back from the body to the heart via the upper vena cava, and the lower vena cava. It enters the right atrium, that propels it to the right ventricle, that propels it to the pulmonary arteries that go to the lungs, where the blood will be filled up with oxygen. Once it is oxygenated, it comes back to the heart via the pulmonary veins, enters the left atrium, goes to the left ventricle, where it is propelled through the aorta, and then to the entire body.  To better understand this description, let’s have a look at the heart in action. Below is an animation of the heart beating, annotated with the different structures we just discussed about: </span></p><p><img src="https://sator.ml/autre/img/keurorf.gif" style="zoom:67%;" /></p><h4><a name="113-types-of-circulation" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>1.1.3. Types of circulation</span></h4><p><big><span>A</span></big><span> closed circulatory system is consequently characterized by specific structures, the different vessels and the muscular pump, the heart. However, natural selection led to multiple organization forms of these components, and consequently multiple operation mechanisms. </span></p><p><big><span>S</span></big><span>ingle circulation in fishes and sharks consists in a single loop during which blood travels throughout the body and returns to its starting point. The heart itself only consists of two chambers, the atrium and the ventricle. The blood located in the atrium first flows inside the ventricle, which contraction sent it to the capillaries in respiratory organs. There, a net diffusion of O2 in the blood and CO2 out of the blood is observed : the O2-rich blood then circulates through a vessel to capillary beds throughout the body, where it releases its O2 to organs. Finally, the deoxygenated blood finishes its loop by returning to the heart. </span></p><p><big><span>M</span></big><span>ammals, like humans, reptiles, birds and amphibians are characterized by the double circulation in their cardiovascular system : the oxygenated blood comes back to the heart after passing to the respiratory organs, in order to be pumped to organs throughout the body. We should then distinguish between the right and left side of the system. </span></p><figure><table><thead><tr><th style='text-align:left;' ><span>Left side of the system</span><br><span>Systemic circuit</span></th><th style='text-align:left;' ><span>Right side of the system</span><br><span>Pulmonary or pulmocutaneous circulation</span></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='text-align:left;' ><span>The now oxygenated blood enters the left side of the heart, which pumps it to capillary beds of the whole body, where gas exchange will take place to supply organs with the necessary oxygen.

Amphibians and reptiles have indeed a heart with three chambers, two atria and a ventricle. A thin barrier within the ventricle allows to divert oxygenated blood to the systemic circuit and O2-poor blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. Alligators, while having a completely divided ventricle, present a connection of left and right arteries at the heart exit. These partial connections between the two distinct circuits allow for these organisms to control the amount of blood flowing to the lungs and the rest of the circuit. They have consequently the ability to shut off the blood flow to unneeded lungs when underwater. </span></p><h3><a name="12-mammals-example--driving-of-double-circulation" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>1.2.

How is the system coordinated ?</span></h4><p><big><span>F</span></big><span>rom your birth to the end of your life, the cardiac cycle allows for your body to function. But how is this system regulated, in order to work properly and adapt to situations affecting the organism ?</span></p><p><big><span>L</span></big><span>et’s firstly discover how the cardiac cycle is coordinated by a set of unique cells within the heart… In vertebrates, the heartbeat originates from the heart itself. Indeed, cardiac muscle cells are said to be autorhythmic, meaning that their contraction and relaxation can happen independently from any signal of the nervous system. Cell contraction occurs via a highly regulated process, due to a potential propagation. At rest, myocardial cells have negative membrane potential. When stimulated above a certain threshold, the opening of voltage-gated ion channels leads to a flow of cations into the cell : it is the depolarization. The latter lead to the opening of voltage gated calcium channels : an influx of Ca2+ then causes the cell contraction. Finally, potassium channels reopen and a flow of K+ out of the cell causes repolarization. But note that every cell has its own frequency of frequency. Thus, an electrical conduction system allows to coordinate and time perfectly the contraction. </span></p><p><big><span>T</span></big><span>he primary orchestrator of the whole system is a group of autorhythmic cells located in the wall of the right atrium, forming the sinoatrial node (SAN). An electrical signal is firstly generated in the SAN, and spread via gap junctions throughout the right atrium. Reaching Bachmann’s bundle, the signal arrives at the left atrium. As a whole, this initial spreading allows to stimulate atrial contraction. The signal then reaches the atrioventricular node (AV node), situated in the interatrial septum, the wall of tissue separating left and right atria. Here, the signal is delayed allowing the atria to completely empty its content into the ventricles before the contraction of the latter. After the atrioventricular node, the signal then passes into the left and right branches of the bundle of His, activating both ventricles. The branching of the bundle into multiple Purkinje fibers allows to stimulate individual groups of myocardial cells to contract, until the signal reaches the heart apex and the epicardium, the outer layer of the heart. The ventricular repolarization finally allows to restore the resting state. </span></p><p style="background:rgba(0,128,0,0.25);padding:12px;text-indent:0px;"><b>Fun fact:</b><br>A normal SAN rhythm lies between 60 to 100 beats per minute (bpm). When the heart displays a lower beating rate, it is said to be bradycardia, and the contrary is called tachycardia.</p> <p style="background:rgba(0,128,0,0.25);padding:12px;text-indent:0px;"><b>Fun fact:</b><br>If the SAN dysfunction, the AV node can take over the electrical impulse initialization. When both fail to initialize electrical impulse, the ventricles can themselves do it ! </p><h4><a name="124-how-is-the-system-regulated-" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>1.2.4. How is the system regulated ?</span></h4><p style="text-indent:0px;">Some other physiological signals have an influence of the SAN and can consequently modify the heart rate. </p><p><big><span>T</span></big><span>he system is complex, and the heart rate consequently depends on many other parameters. First of all, let’s get interested in the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Part of the peripheral nervous system and controlled by centres located in the spinal cord, brainstem and hypothalamus, it regulates many components of homeostasis, such as blood pressure, body temperature and… heart rate. The ANS is divided in two interacting systems, with antagonistic effect : the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic system prepares the body for energy expenditure, for example in stressful situations, by releasing specific hormones. The binding of the latter to receptors expressed in the heart increases intracellular Ca</span><sup><span>2+</span></sup><span> concentration and consequently increases heart rate and contractility. On the other hand, the parasympathetic system is active in restful situations. For example, when acetylcholine binds to specific receptors in the heart, it decreases the rate of depolarization and the conduction velocity in the AV node, thus reducing the overall cardiac output. </span></p><p><big><span>T</span></big><span>he cardiovascular system is also heavily influenced by physiological, neurological, and pathological factors. Firstly the endocrine system : while epinephrine or adrenaline can increase contractility by altering the sympathetic system, oestradiol tends to preferentially induce a parasympathetic activity. Temperature and humidity also have an influence on the heart rate : an increase of the body temperature of 1°C can raise the heart rate by 10 beats per minute ! (source = livre). Respiratory factors also have an important role to play : the heartbeat increases as air is breathed and decreased with expiration. </span></p><p><big><span>F</span></big><span>inally, some environmental and lifestyle factors, such body position, exercise, energy drinks and alcohol, stress, medications and non-modifiable factors, such as age or gender affect the heart rate, by inducing the SAN directly, or by activating either the parasympathetic or the sympathetic nervous system. </span></p><h3><a name="13-blood-tissue" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>1.3.

In fact, this open characteristic of the lymphatic system is key to its main function, maintaining fluid balance in tissues. </span></p><p style="text-indent:0px;font-size:85%;background:rgba(0,0,0,0.15);padding:12px;"><b><u>N.B.</u></b> : the adjective corresponding to lymph is lymphoid, while lymphatic is specific to the circulatory system of lymph fluid.</p><h4><a name="311-fluid-balance" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>3.1.1. Fluid balance</span></h4><p><big><span>A</span></big><span>s blood flows through capillaries, it irrigates tissue as some blood plasma, packed with the nutrients needed by tissue cells, seeps through small pores in the vessels. This liquid finds its way in the tissue itself, where it is known as </span><strong><span>interstitial</span></strong><span> (or extracellular) </span><strong><span>fluid</span></strong><span>. Some of this extra plasma, once its resources have been depleted, flows back in the blood capillaries, but not at a rate sufficient to stop accumulation. If this reserve of fluid builds up, it leads to a condition known as hypovolemia, a reduction of the volume of circulating blood, which may lead to hypotension, acidification of the blood and eventually heart failure. In addition to that, interstitial fluid contains various concentrations of essential proteins, which can&#39;t be lost out of the vessels. To avoid these unfortunate conditions, the random luck of evolution has gradually elaborated a variety of small lymphatic capillaries, able to drain this interstitial fluid from tissues, and to redirect it to blood circulation by use of a network of vessels, propelled by small muscles. Along the lymphatic vessels, a series of </span><strong><span>valves</span></strong><span> avoid reflux, as the smaller vessels lead to greater ones, called </span><strong><span>lymphatic trunks</span></strong><span>, eventually opening on to veins, at </span><strong><span>lymphatic ducts</span></strong><span>.

<span>This intake of energy and molecules has taken many simple forms before evolving into the digestive system as we know it in humans and other mammals.</span></p><h4><a name="321-early-forms" class="md-header-anchor"></a><span>3.2.1.

This is highly beneficial to animals, as it allows for assimilation of food larger than the cell and thus higher alimentary diversity, and doesn&#39;t rely on the mass production of lysosomes, which was energetically costly and required a very large exchange area.</span>

It is then processed and </span><strong><span>absorbed</span></strong><span> into the organism as it passes through a </span><strong><span>digestive tract</span></strong><span>, composed of a variety of cavities and organs specialised in different functions, the </span><strong><span>guts</span></strong><span>.

Some mechanical and chemical processing of foods can also be done in the mouth, thanks to diverse glands, bones and muscles.</span></p><p><img src="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574021/bin/WDEV-6-na-g005.jpg" style="zoom: 67%;" /></p><p style="color:#303030;text-align:center;font-size:80%;text-indent:0px;">Mouths in various animal <br>Md : mandible, Mx : maxilla, P : pharynx, T : teeth, Tg : tongue.<br><small>(Chen et al. 2017)</small></p><p><span>The inner gut structure of animals can be separated in four basic types :</span></p><ul><li><strong><span>Monogastric</span></strong><span> : very common in mammals, including humans, the digestive system contains a single stomach chamber. The food, after being ingested at the mouth, is passed through the oesophagus to the stomach by </span><strong><span>deglutition</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>peristalsis</span></strong><span>, a wave-like smooth (autonomous) muscle contraction. The stomach is an acidic chamber in which digestive enzymes can function optimally and some pathogens are killed. From there, the partially digested food makes its way to the small intestine, where enzymes secreted in the liver, pancreas and other glands act to break it down further, and nutrients are absorbed through epithelial cells organized in the previously mentioned villi. A number of monogastric systems contain a </span><strong><span>cecum</span></strong><span>, a cavity used to store digested food, in the aim of ingesting and digesting them again. The end of the digestive tracts consists in a large intestine (or colon), which absorbs mostly water and ions, drying up the processed food into </span><strong><span>faeces</span></strong><span>, which is then excreted through the anus by bowel movements.</span></li><li><strong><span>Avian</span></strong><span> : The difference between monogastric and avian guts comes mostly from the lack of mechanical processing in the mouth of birds. Indeed, while early mastication allows for an easy processing of food in the digestive tract, the avian stomach must take this function. The stomach is thus separated in two chambers, the </span><strong><span>proventriculus</span></strong><span> which produces the necessary gastric juices, and the highly musculated </span><strong><span>gizzard</span></strong><span>, where food is then soaked and mechanically ground.</span>
<span>As is the case in many other animals, the avian digestive system contains a </span><strong><span>crop</span></strong><span>, a cavity used for storage of food, close to the beginning of the digestive tract.</span>
<span>Finally, the avian function of excretion goes to the unique </span><strong><span>cloaca</span></strong><span> opening, rather than a specific anus.</span></li><li><strong><span>Ruminant</span></strong><span> : Animals that are classified as ruminants are generally herbivores, and feed mostly on </span><strong><span>cellulose</span></strong><span>.

<span>Finally, some insects possess Malpighian tubules, which work a bit like intestinal villi, lining the gut and bathing in haemolymph. Ion pumps cause water to follow an osmotic gradient, forming urine with the waste.
